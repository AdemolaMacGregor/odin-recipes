    <h2>Hard Boiled Egg Casserole for Brunch</h2>
    <p>This is an easy Easter brunch casserole that's low in carbs — ideal if any of your guests are following the keto
        diet — yet high in flavor. Two types of cheese and a few spice cabinet staples, including dry mustard and garlic
        powder, make all the difference to elevate this quick and easy casserole to holiday-worthy territory.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and halved</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups half-and-half</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Gruyere cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cooking Steps!</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep Oven! </strong> Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9-inch square
            baking dish.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li><strong>Position eggs! </strong> Arrange eggs, cut-side down, in the prepared
            baking dish.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li><strong>Whisk and Mix! </strong> Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk flour
            into the melted butter until dissolved, 2 to 3 minutes. Gradually stir half-and-half into flour mixture
            until sauce is thickened and smooth, about 5 minutes. Season sauce with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and
            mustard. Stir Gruyere cheese into sauce until melted and smooth.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li><strong>Cheese It! </strong> Pour sauce over eggs and sprinkle Parmesan cheese over sauce.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li><strong>Bake. </strong> Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and golden brown,
            20 to 25 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
